## **Comparing different Machine Learning models using a dataset**

## **Overview**
  This project focuses on comparing the performance of various machine learning models on a dataset (diabetes.csv). It involves data exploration, preprocessing, and evaluation of models using standard performance metrics. The objective is to identify the most suitable model for the given dataset and problem type.

**Working Process**
1. Load Dataset: Import the dataset using pandas.
2. EDA and Visualization: Explore dataset features and visualize distributions using seaborn and matplotlib.
3. Preprocessing: Clean the data and prepare it for modeling.
4. Model Training and Comparison: Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
5. Select the Best Model: Identify the most suitable model based on performance metrics.

## **Features:**
1. Data Exploration: Provides insights into the dataset's structure, data types, and distributions.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and performs feature scaling.
3. Model Comparison: Evaluates multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM).
4. Performance Metrics: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for evaluation.  

## **Dataset**
1. Name: diabetes.csv
2. Features: Includes multiple attributes related to medical diagnostics.
3. Target: Classification of samples based on diabetes diagnosis.
